## What is qbite dashboard

[Qbite](https://q-bite.net/) helps restaurants make QR codes and manage their menus. It lets them customize the design with different colors, making it attractive for customers. The menu can be in different languages and show prices in different currencies. It makes it easier for customers to understand and order food.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
